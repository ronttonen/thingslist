######Instructions
*The main page will display all the Things, sorted by last edit time <br />
A page to create a Thing <br />
A page to edit a Thing (+ button to remove) <br />
A page to view an announce <br />
A page to contact the author of an announce <br />
There are no user accounts; anyone can create an announce anonymously <br />
After the creation, an email should be sent to the user, with a link containing the URL to edit a Thing. <br />
The URL must contain a unique and random token: this will protect the announce to be edited by someone else If a user wants to contact the creator, he or she must fill a form with their email and message. <br />
An email will be sent to the creator with the information from the form
